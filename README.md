# Landing Page Project
My project is the implementation of a landing page and it is fully dynamic as when you want to add a new section in your web application it can be added dynamically in the navigation bar in addition to when you click on any section of the navigation bar it will scroll smoothly to the targeted section.
And the background color will change when you scroll into it and this background color will disappere when you left out the section 
This project is implemented by JS as this technology helps us to build our dynamical web application.

## Instructions
step one    : open the browser 
step two    : you will find the navbar contains the sections 
step three  : by clicking the target section scroll smoothly into the section 

The starter project has some HTML and CSS styling to display a static version of the Landing Page project. You'll need to convert this project from a static project to an interactive one. This will require modifying the HTML and CSS files, but primarily the JavaScript file.

To get started, open `js/app.js` and start building out the app's functionality

For specific, detailed instructions, look at the project instructions in the Udacity Classroom.
